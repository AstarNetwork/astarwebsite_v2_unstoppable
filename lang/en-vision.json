Astar 2.0 gives developers the tools to build toward a better future web for all.",

For the second iteration, we're updating our staking program to better align incentives between projects, builders, and users, ensuring that everyone benefits. Astar 2.0 will focus on creating seamless user experiences adding data as well as further integrations to become the go-to place to support and reward developers.",

By working closely with leading enterprises, Startale will play a pivotal role in onboarding new users to Astar and pave the way for them to expand beyond the borders of Japan.",
    "tokenomics": "As the network evolves, so do our tokenomics. We're revising our tokenomics to best serve the needs of network participants, from users and builders to enterprise partners. With Tokenomics 2.0, you can expect a sustainable token structure and a lower inflation rate. Keep up to date with the latest on our forum.",

    "link": "Astar is evolving into Astar Link, a hub connecting all currently fragmented layers of the blockchain industry to provide a unified experience for developers and users. Combining great flexibility and customization options, builders can create unique solutions limited only by their imagination. All of this is powered by tailor-made SDKs that offer a solution for any use-case to be implemented on top of our smart contract multi-virtual machine hub. \n\nAstar Link unlocks a vast plethora of use cases that were held back by a lack of tools or fragmentation from gaming to enterprise.",
    "supernova": "Astar zkEVM is the new Layer-2 solution to scale a web3 experience on Ethereum with zero knowledge (ZK) technology. Astar Network adds an EVM equivalent environment to their protocol that seamlessly integrates with existing smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets on Ethereum."
